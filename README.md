# FALL2024-chandy-lamport-fidge-mattern
Implement a config-driven distributed system of n nodes communicating over persistent bidirectional FIFO sockets (TCP/SCTP) that run the MAP active/passive messaging protocol, use Chandy–Lamport snapshots, plus Fidge/Mattern vector clocks to detect and verify MAP termination, and then execute a protocol to bring all nodes to a halt.
